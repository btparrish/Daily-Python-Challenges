# Daily-Python-Challenges
Repository of my completing daily python projects for practice out of a popular python projects book.

My preliminary goal is to complete two python small projects daily, but this schedule might be too ambitious given my
work schedule and everything else going on. Will commit new projects as often as I can!

In December 2021, I will be working through @Eric Wastl's Advent of Code, a Holiday-themed coding competition. I will be posting the challenges and their solutions in this repository in a dedicated folder.
