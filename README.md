# Daily-Python-Challenges
Repository of my completing daily python projects for practice out of a popular python projects book.

My preliminary goal is to complete two python small projects daily, but this schedule might be too ambitious given my
work schedule and everything else going on. Will commit new projects as often as I can!

In December 2021, I will be working through Eric Wastl's Advent of Code, a Holiday-themed coding competition. I will be posting the challenges and their solutions in this repository in a dedicated folder.

Update from April 2022 -- never got around to completing Advent of Code in December of 2021, although I greatly regret it since the challenges are so well constructed and thoughtful. In an effort to revive, instead of simply coding the challenges, I will be coding them with an emphasis of completing them as soon as possible. Timed challenge solutions will have the amount of time that it took me to complete them at the top of the scripts in a comment.
